My exprience and results while learning the data structure and algorithm.
## Aymptotic analysis
## Master theorem
## Alogrithm Concept

It step by step method of solving the specific problems

### Examples

#### adding two numbers

the analysis: we add two numbers, so we need storage(variable) for each and another for sum

```algorithm
    1. start
    2. Declare the variables for two numbers
    3. Accept the input for the two numbers
    4. make the sum of two numbers and store the sum into variable
    5. display or return a sum
    6. end
```

## Data structure concept

It is way of organising the data that it may be stored, accessed and used efficiently.
